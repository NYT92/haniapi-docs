# Server Configuration

We provided the configuration file and now you can config your server.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❌">
    Never config the API URL, it might break the API for some routes.
</Callout>

## Rate-Limit Configuration

If you want to protect your server from overloaded, you could configure the rate-limit for your server.  
Our Default Rate-Limit is 180 request per minute *180 per minute*, To change the Rate-Limit, you can use the following configuration.

````config
[serv_config]
req = 100 per minute
search_req = 200 per minute
````
I have separated req and search_req because the search_req have to request more search for the user than the req. 
If you want to change the default config for your server, you can use the following configuration.

````config
[serv_config]
req = (number) per (time)
search_req = (number) per (time)
````
By using [Flask-Limiter API](https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#rate-limit-string-notation), you can configure the rate-limit with this type of time: 
- second
- minute 
- hour
- day 
- month
- year
*OPTIONAL : You can add (s) to those if you want to make it plural*
